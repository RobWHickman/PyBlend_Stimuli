# PyBlend Stimuli
Work in the Summerfield Lab 2017

Some small scripts to run python through the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3D creation suite. Written in the Summerfield Lab as a research assistant in 2017.

Generates 3D stimuli that vary in two dimensions. Primarily worked with generated leafy vs branchy tree stimuli (see tree_blend) and started extending into planet stimuli (planet_blend). 

As of 2019, tree stimuli should work and planet stimuli is more for fun/to provide a basis for any study that needs many dimensions (e.g. water/ size/ rings/ etc. etc.). A full guide is present in the tree_blend README.
