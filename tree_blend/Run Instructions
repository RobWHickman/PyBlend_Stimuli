1) Clone the repo somewhere on your PC using https://github.com/RobWHickman/Summerfield-Lab.git or the GUI
  1.2) Extract the downloaded file. You can prune away all except the tree_blend folder if you so wish but
  will need to update the filepaths in the Random Forest script
2) Install Blender from https://www.blender.org/download/
3) Run:

cd "/home/path/to/tree_blend/Scripts"
current_file = "Random Forest x.y.z"
blender -b -P ./current_file

This is also in the README
