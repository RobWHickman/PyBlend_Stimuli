1) Clone the repo somewhere on your PC using https://github.com/RobWHickman/Summerfield-Lab.git or the GUI
  1.2) Extract the downloaded file. You can prune away all except the tree_blend folder if you so wish but
  will need to update the filepaths in the Random Forest script
2) Install Blender from https://www.blender.org/download/
3) Run in the command shell:

#change directory to the scripts folder
cd "/home/path/to/tree_blend/Scripts"
#run the script through python in blender headless
#add in numbers for latest file
blender -b -P ./"Random Forest x.y.z"
